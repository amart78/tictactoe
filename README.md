# tictactoe

Let's play tictactoe! Tic tac toe is a 2-player game in which each player is either assigned as 'X' or 'O'. In a 3x3 gameboard, the players take turns putting their symbol in open spaces on the game board with the goal of getting 3 in a row either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The game will automatically reset once there is either a winner or a tie game (a tie game being a full game board where neither person got 3 in a row). To play, simply run this program in the terminal. 

This program was made with python with the intention of using minimal pre-built functions.

GLHF!
